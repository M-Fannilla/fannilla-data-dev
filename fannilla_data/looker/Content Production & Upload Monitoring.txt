How many uploads happen each day/week?

   SELECT 
       event_date,
       SUM(total_transcode_attempts) as daily_uploads
   FROM fact_content_transcoding_metrics
   GROUP BY event_date
   ORDER BY event_date;

Are there spikes in transcoder failures?
   SELECT 
       event_date,
       transcoder_type,
       failure_rate,
       failed_transcodes
   FROM fact_content_transcoding_metrics
   WHERE failure_rate > 0.1  -- Alert threshold of 10%
   ORDER BY failure_rate DESC;
